			Apprenticeship training course
		</h1>

		<p>
			Apprentices will spend at least 20% of their time on off-the-job training with your chosen training provider. Apprenticeships offer the opportunity to have a flexible, but structured training programme, that meet your organisation's needs.
		</p>

		<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
			Types of apprenticeships
		</h2>


		<p>
			Apprentices must work towards an approved apprenticeship. Their training must last at least 1 year.
		</p>

		<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
			Apprenticeship standards
		</h2>

		<p>
			Designed by groups of employers, apprenticeship standards set out the knowledge, skills and behaviours the apprentice needs to be competent in a particular occupation. Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education is responsible for the development and approval of standards and works with employers to ensure a wide range of high-quality apprenticeship standards are available.
		</p>

		<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
			Apprenticeship frameworks
		</h2>

		<p>
			Apprenticeship frameworks are a series of work-related qualifications. There is no end-point assessment for this type of apprenticeship.
		</p>
		<p>
			All apprenticeship frameworks will be withdrawn by 2020. This will be a phased approach as employers take on more apprentices using the new apprenticeship standards. 
		</p>
