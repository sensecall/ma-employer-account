		<p>
			Before you can set up an apprenticeship, you need to know the approximate training start date.
		</p>

		<p>
			Ask your training provider when the apprenticeship training will start. You can get their contact details from <a href="https://findapprenticeshiptraining.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/provider/search">find apprenticeship training</a>.

		<p>
			 Try again once you know when the apprenticeship training will start.
